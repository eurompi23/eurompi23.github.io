<p>EuroMPI 2023 invites submissions for posters and short papers that showcase innovative contributions related to the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and related or competing models. We welcome contributions from both academia and industry, including early-stage work that presents new ideas, interesting preliminary results, or new directions for research.</p>

<p>Posters and short papers provide an excellent opportunity to present your work to the community, receive constructive feedback, and establish collaborations with researchers and practitioners in the field of parallel programming. We encourage submissions from all areas of message-passing parallel programming, including but not limited to:</p>

Programmability:
<ul>
<li> MPI and heterogeneous programming</li>
<li> Challenges and opportunities with new networking hardware</li>
<li> New interfaces for MPI</li>
<li> Testing of MPI programs</li>
</ul>

Dynamic processes:
<ul>
<li> Challenges and opportunities of dynamicity/malleability in MPI</li>
<li> Usage of MPI in workflows</li>
</ul>

Use Cases:
<ul>
<li> Performance evaluations of MPI on various payloads</li>
<li> Possible limitations of MPI for specific use cases</li>
<li> Comparison with alternative approaches (PGAS, DSLs, etc.)</li>
</ul>

Tools, Models and Monitoring:
<ul>
<li> Tools and approaches for profiling and monitoring MPI programs</li>
<li> Performance models and algorithms studies linked with MPI</li>
<li> New introspection and profiling interfaces</li>
</ul>

<p>All submissions will undergo a peer-review process, with each submission receiving at least two reviews. The reviews are single-blind, and the names of the authors will be seen by the reviewers.</p> 
 
<p>Accepted posters and short papers will be presented during the poster session at EuroMPI 2023, providing an excellent opportunity for networking and discussions with the conference attendees. The accepted short papers and posters will be published informally on the conference website. We encourage all researchers and practitioners to submit their innovative work for poster or short paper presentation at EuroMPI 2023. We look forward to your submissions and to seeing you in Bristol.</p>
