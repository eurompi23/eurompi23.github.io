# Welcome to EuroMPI'23 


In 2023, EuroMPI Conference will take place in Bristol on September 11-13, 2023. The conference will be co-located with the 19th International Workshop on OpenMP (IWOMP 2023) that will be held on September XXX,2023. The MPI Forum will also meet following the EuroMPI Conference. 


The EuroMPI conference is the preeminent meeting for users, developers and researchers to interact and discuss new developments and applications of the Message Passing Interface (MPI). This includes new proposed concepts and extensions to the MPI standard, libraries and languages built on top of MPI, interfaces to other standards in parallel programming, applications and optimizations to new architectures and networks, novel algorithms, and tools, with particular focus on quality, portability, performance, and scalability. The annual meeting has a long, rich tradition, and has been held since 1994.


Through the presentation of contributed papers, posters and invited talks, the meeting will provide ample opportunities for attendees to interact and share ideas and experiences to contribute to the improvement and furthering of message-passing and related parallel programming paradigms.
